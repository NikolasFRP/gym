Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return _the reversed list_.

**Example 1:**

![](img1.jpg)

| Input | Output |
| --- | --- |
|[1->2->3->4->5]|[5->4->3->2->1]|

**Example 2:**

![](img2.jpg)

| Input | Output |
| --- | --- |
| [1->2] | [2->1]|

**Example 3:**

| Input | Output |
| --- | --- |
| head = \[\] | \[\]|

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is the range $[0, 5000]$.
- $-5000 <=$ `Node.val` $<= 5000$

**Follow up:** A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?
